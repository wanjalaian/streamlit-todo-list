# streamlit-todo-list

This is a simple to-do list app built with Python and Streamlit. It allows you to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as complete or incomplete.

Getting started
Prerequisites
Before you can run the app, you'll need to install the following libraries:

Streamlit

You can do this using the following command:


pip install streamlit pandas datetime sqlite3

Running the app
To run the app, simply navigate to the directory where the app.py file is located and run the following command:


streamlit run app.py
This will start the app on your local machine, and you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8501.

Usage
When you first open the app, you'll see a form for adding a new task. Simply enter the name of the task and the due date, and click the "Add task" button to add it to the list.

You can view all the tasks in the list by scrolling down. Each task will be displayed with its name and due date, as well as buttons to mark it as complete or incomplete and to delete it.

To mark a task as complete or incomplete, simply click the corresponding button next to the task. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to it.
